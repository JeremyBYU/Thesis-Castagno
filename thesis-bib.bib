  abstract = {We present a new algorithm, called marching cubes, that creates triangle models of constant density surfaces from 3D medical data. Using a divide-and-conquer approach to generate inter-slice connectivity, we create a case table that defines triangle topology. The algorithm processes the 3D medical data in scan-line order and calculates triangle vertices using linear interpolation. We find the gradient of the original data, normalize it, and use it as a basis for shading the models. The detail in images produced from the generated surface models is the result of maintaining the inter-slice connectivity, surface data, and gradient information present in the original 3D data. Results from computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) illustrate the quality and functionality of marching cubes. We also discuss improvements that decrease processing time and add solid modeling capabilities.},

  abstract = {Flat surfaces captured by 3D point clouds are often used for localization, mapping, and modeling. Dense point cloud processing has high computation and memory costs making low-dimensional representations of flat surfaces such as polygons desirable. We present Polylidar3D, a non-convex polygon extraction algorithm which takes as input unorganized 3D point clouds (e.g., LiDAR data), organized point clouds (e.g., range images), or user-provided meshes. Non-convex polygons represent flat surfaces in an environment with interior cutouts representing obstacles or holes. The Polylidar3D front-end transforms input data into a half-edge triangular mesh. This representation provides a common level of abstraction for subsequent back-end processing. The Polylidar3D back-end is composed of four core algorithms: mesh smoothing, dominant plane normal estimation, planar segment extraction, and finally polygon extraction. Polylidar3D is shown to be quite fast, making use of CPU multi-threading and GPU acceleration when available. We demonstrate Polylidar3D\&rsquo;s versatility and speed with real-world datasets including aerial LiDAR point clouds for rooftop mapping, autonomous driving LiDAR point clouds for road surface detection, and RGBD cameras for indoor floor/wall detection. We also evaluate Polylidar3D on a challenging planar segmentation benchmark dataset. Results consistently show excellent speed and accuracy.},

Recently Intel released a new lineup of Intel RealSense RGB-D cameras that have favorable characteristics for legged robots, specifically in terms of resolution, frames per second, form factor, weight, and price range. However, because these active stereo sensors are noisy for reasons such as non-overlapping image regions or lack of texture, it is beneficial to empirically model the noise. Systematic errors, specifically the distance inhomogeneity and depth bias, are observed to recognize and verify the limitations of the camera. We also analyze the non-systematic error by modeling both the axial and lateral noise as a function of distance and angle of incidence using a Gaussian distribution for its versatile applicability for mobile robots in mapping.},

As it usually requires a potential analysis over the area of interest, a crucial step is to estimate the geometric characteristics of the building rooftops. In this paper, we introduce a multi-layer machine learning methodology to classify 6 roof types, 9 aspect (azimuth) classes and 5 slope (tilt) classes for all building rooftops in Switzerland, using GIS processing. We train Random Forests (RF), an ensemble learning algorithm, to build the classifiers. We use (2 \&times; 2) [m\textsuperscript{2} ] LiDAR data (considering buildings and vegetation) to extract several rooftop features, and a generalised footprint polygon data to localize buildings. The roof classifier is trained and tested with 1252 labeled roofs from three different urban areas, namely Baden, Luzern, and Winterthur. The results for roof type classification show an average accuracy of 67\%. The aspect and slope classifiers are trained and tested with 11449 labeled roofs in the Zurich periphery area. The results for aspect and slope classification show different accuracies depending on the classes: while some classes are well identified, other under-represented classes remain challenging to detect.},

The variation of the point density at both extreme ends of the oscillating mirror scan is meaningful. It will be demonstrated that excluding the extreme sectors across the strip corresponding to 1/8 of the swath width (12.5\% of the sampling area, half in each side) for the computation of the mean density value is enough to satisfy light detection and ranging (LiDAR) specifications for national level surveys.     ~     Key words:~Light detection and ranging (LiDAR), point density, point distribution.},

For this reason, it is important to know how to preserve them and assess their exploitation potential from different perspectives. An increased knowledge about them is continuously required and demanded. Three-dimensional (henceforth 3D) virtual models are an excellent way for introducing these cities to people. However, some particular characteristics derived from irregular urban structures and specific human dynamics in historical urban environments can constrain the use of some technologies for 3D data collection. This research paper proposes an own working methodology for the generation of 3D virtual models of historical cities. This methodology is based on the combined use of laser scanning and photogrammetric techniques, which complement each other. As a result, a 3D virtual model with high geometric accuracy and visual completeness is obtained and integrated into a web-based application. Resulting virtual models can be used for touristic promotion, navigation, urban planning, documentation and preservation of cultural heritage, etc.},

The principle of the BPA is very simple: Three points form a triangle if a ball of a user-specified radius p touches them without containing any other point. Starting with a seed triangle, the ball pivots around an edge (i.e., it revolves around the edge while keeping in contact with the edge's endpoints) until it touches another point, forming another triangle. The process continues until all reachable edges have been tried, and then starts from another seed triangle, until all points have been considered. The process can then be repeated with a ball of larger radius to handle uneven sampling densities. We applied the BPA to datasets of millions of points representing actual scans of complex 3D objects. The relatively small amount of memory required by the BPA, its time efficiency, and the quality of the results obtained compare favorably with existing techniques.},

We exploit the fact that typical indoor scenes have an abundance of planar features by modeling environments as sets of plane polygons. To this end, we build upon the Fast Sampling Plane Filtering (FSPF) algorithm that extracts points belonging to local neighborhoods of planes from depth images, even in the presence of clutter. We introduce an algorithm that uses the FSPF-generated plane filtered point clouds to generate convex polygons from individual observed depth images. We then contribute an approach of merging these detected polygons across successive frames while accounting for a complete history of observed plane filtered points without explicitly maintaining a list of all observed points. The FSPF and polygon merging algorithms run in real time at full camera frame rates with low CPU requirements: in a real world indoor environment scene, the FSPF and polygon merging algorithms take 2.5 ms on average to process a single 640 \texttimes{} 480 depth image. We provide experimental results demonstrating the computational efficiency of the algorithm and the accuracy of the detected plane polygons by comparing with ground truth.},

In this article we evaluate different variants of the Hough Transform with respect to their applicability to detect planes in 3D point clouds reliably. Apart from computational costs, the main problem is the representation of the accumulator. Usual implementations favor geometrical objects with certain parameters due to uneven sampling of the parameter space.

One of the key challenges for successful reconstruction of three-dimensional (3D) building models from airborne lidar point clouds is achieving high quality recognition and segmentation of the roof planar points. Unfortunately, the current automatic extraction processes for planar surfaces continue to suffer from limitations such as sensitivity to the selection of seed points and the lack of computational efficiency. In order to address these drawbacks, a new fully automatic segmentation method is proposed in this article, which is capable of the following: (1) processing a roof point dataset with an arbitrary shape; (2) robustly selecting the seed points in a parameter space with reduced dimensions; and (3) segmenting the planar patches in a sub-dataset with similar attributes when region growing in the object space. The detection of seed points in the parameter space was improved by mapping the accumulator array to a 1D space. The range for region growing in the object space was reduced by an attribute similarity measure that split the roof dataset into candidate and non-candidate subsets. The experimental results confirmed that the proposed approach can extract planar patches of building roofs robustly and efficiently.},

  abstract = {The expected proliferation of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) has prompted many to question their safety and reliability, particularly in urban areas. Failures and anomalies can lead to the need for emergency landing, which in turn requires the UAS operator or autonomy to rapidly identify and evaluate the risks for possible landing sites and trajectories to reach these sites. This paper proposes a method to optimize the overall emergency landing site and flight path risks. Although sensors can scan an immediate area, no safe site might be observable in which case pre-processed data on more distant safe sites is required. For example, in urban regions, out of sight flat rooftops may pose less risk to people and property than landing in streets or sidewalks. This paper proposes the offline construction of a landing site database using a variety of public data sources, uniquely allowing for the assessment of risk associated with a rooftop landing. A real-time map-based planner is presented that demonstrates a novel trade-off between landing site risk and path risk and provides a heuristic to improve decision-making efficiency.},

Plane segmented point clouds can be input into Polylidar to extract their polygonal counterpart, thereby reducing map size and improving visualization. The algorithm begins by triangulating the point set and filtering triangles by user configurable parameters such as triangle edge length. Next, connected triangles are extracted into triangular mesh regions representing the shape of the point set. Finally each region is converted to a polygon through a novel boundary following method which accounts for holes. Real-world and synthetic benchmarks are presented to comparatively evaluate Polylidar speed and accuracy. Results show comparable accuracy and more than four times speedup compared to other concave polygon extraction methods.},

Aircraft, particularly small unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), can exploit this and additional information such as building roof structure to improve navigation accuracy and safely perform contingency landings particularly in urban regions. However, building roof structure is not fully provided in maps. This paper proposes a method to automatically label building roof shape from publicly available GIS data. Satellite imagery and airborne LiDAR data are processed and manually labeled to create a diverse annotated roof image dataset for small to large urban cities. Multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures are trained and tested, with the best performing networks providing a condensed feature set for support vector machine and decision tree classifiers. Satellite image and LiDAR data fusion is shown to provide greater classification accuracy than using either data type alone. Model confidence thresholds are adjusted leading to significant increases in models precision. Networks trained from roof data in Witten, Germany and Manhattan (New York City) are evaluated on independent data from these cities and Ann Arbor, Michigan.},

  abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the method of choice for learning problems involving 2D planar images. However, a number of problems of recent interest have created a demand for models that can analyze spherical images. Examples include omnidirectional vision for drones, robots, and autonomous cars, molecular regression problems, and global weather and climate modelling. A naive application of convolutional networks to a planar projection of the spherical signal is destined to fail, because the space-varying distortions introduced by such a projection will make translational weight sharing ineffective. In this paper we introduce the building blocks for constructing spherical CNNs. We propose a definition for the spherical cross-correlation that is both expressive and rotation-equivariant. The spherical correlation satisfies a generalized Fourier theorem, which allows us to compute it efficiently using a generalized (non-commutative) Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. We demonstrate the computational efficiency, numerical accuracy, and effectiveness of spherical CNNs applied to 3D model recognition and atomization energy regression.},

With a knowledge of the aircraft's state and parameters, as well as a known wind profile, the area of maximum glide range can be calculated using aircraft equations of motion for gliding flight. A landing descent circuit technique used by human pilots carrying out forced landings called high key low key is employed to account for the extra glide distance required for an approach and landing. By combining maximum glide range analysis with the descent circuit, all the reachable landing sites can be determined. X-Plane flight simulator is used to demonstrate and validate the techniques presented.},

The contributions of the work are twofold: (1) a perception system that employs a dense motion stereo approach that determines the 3D model of the captured scene without the need of geo-referenced images, scene geometry constraints, or external navigation aids; and (2) an online trajectory generation approach that balances the need to concurrently explore available rooftop vantages of an interest point while ensuring confidence in the landing site suitability by considering the impact of landing site uncertainty as assessed by the perception system. Simulation and experimental evaluation of the performance of the perception and trajectory generation methodologies are analyzed independently and jointly in order to establish the efficacy and robustness of the proposed approach.},

These factors result in a higher probability of a forced or emergency landing scenario. Currently, general aviation relies on the pilot to select a landing site and plan a trajectory, even though workload in an emergency is typically high, and decisions must be made rapidly. Although sensors can provide local real-time information, awareness of more distant or occluded regions requires database and/or offboard data sources. This paper considers different data sources and how to process these data to inform an emergency landing planner regarding risks posed to property, people on the ground, and the aircraft itself. Detailed terrain data are used for selection of candidate emergency landing sites. Mobile phone activity is evaluated as a means of real-time occupancy estimation. Occupancy estimates are combined with population census data to estimate emergency landing risk to people on the ground.

Using a grid that approximates population density over the entire country seems like the most practical approach to exploring and distributing detailed population data but instead data based on census aggregation units is still the most widely used method. In this paper we describe the construction of 30m resolution grid representing the distribution of population in 2010 over the entire conterminous United States. The grid is computed using 2010 U.S. Census block level population counts disaggregated by a dasymetric model that uses land cover (2011 NLCD) and land use (2010 NLUD) as ancillary data. Detailed descriptions of the ancillary data and dasymetric model are given. Methods of computing the grid are presented followed by an extensive assessment of model accuracy. Overall the expected value for relative error of the model is 44\% which is at the lower limit of errors reported for other continental-sized, high resolution population grids. We also offer a more specific error estimate for areas with specified value of population density. Using two example areas, one highly urbanized and another rural, we demonstrate the advantages of using the gridded population data over the census block-based data. Our 30m population grid is available for online exploration and for download from the custom-made GeoWeb application SocScape at http://sil.uc.edu.},

The algorithm is based on the Delaunay triangulation of the points. The shape produced by the algorithm is controlled by a single normalized parameter, which can be used to generate a finite, totally ordered family of related characteristic shapes, varying between the convex hull at one extreme and a uniquely defined shape with minimum area. An optimal O(nlogn) algorithm for computing the shapes is presented. Characteristic shapes possess a number of desirable properties, and the paper includes an empirical investigation of the shapes produced by the algorithm. This investigation provides experimental evidence that with appropriate parameterization the algorithm is able to accurately characterize the shape of a wide range of different point distributions and densities. The experiments detail the effects of changing parameter values and provide an indication of some ``good'' parameter values to use in certain circumstances.},

We present a novel algorithm for reliably detecting multiple planes in real time in organized point clouds obtained from devices such as Kinect sensors. By uniformly dividing such a point cloud into non-overlapping groups of points in the image space, we first construct a graph whose node and edge represent a group of points and their neighborhood respectively. We then perform an agglomerative hierarchical clustering on this graph to systematically merge nodes belonging to the same plane until the plane fitting mean squared error exceeds a threshold. Finally we refine the extracted planes using pixel-wise region growing. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can reliably detect all major planes in the scene at a frame rate of more than 35Hz for 640\texttimes 480 point clouds, which to the best of our knowledge is much faster than state-of-the-art algorithms.},

The system runs on an on-board smartphone processor and requires only the input of a single downlooking camera and an inertial measurement unit. We generate a two-dimensional elevation map that is probabilistic, of fixed size, and robot-centric, thus, always covering the area immediately underneath the robot. The elevation map is continuously updated at a rate of 1 Hz with depth maps that are triangulated from multiple views using recursive Bayesian estimation. To highlight the usefulness of the proposed mapping framework for autonomous navigation of micro aerial vehicles, we successfully demonstrate fully autonomous landing including landing-spot detection in real-world experiments.},

  abstract = {Researchers have long sought to distinguish between single-process and dual-process cognitive phenomena, using responses such as reaction times and, more recently, hand movements. Analysis of a response distribution's modality has been crucial in detecting the presence of dual processes, because they tend to introduce bimodal features. Rarely, however, have bimodality measures been systematically evaluated. We carried out tests of readily available bimodality measures that any researcher may easily employ: the bimodality coefficient (BC), Hartigan's dip statistic (HDS), and the difference in Akaike's information criterion between one-component and two-component distribution models (AICdiff). We simulated distributions containing two response populations and examined the influences of (1) the distances between populations, (2) proportions of responses, (3) the amount of positive skew present, and (4) sample size. Distance always had a stronger effect than did proportion, and the effects of proportion greatly differed across the measures. Skew biased the measures by increasing bimodality detection, in some cases leading to anomalous interactive effects. BC and HDS were generally convergent, but a number of important discrepancies were found. AICdiff was extremely sensitive to bimodality and identified nearly all distributions as bimodal. However, all measures served to detect the presence of bimodality in comparison to unimodal simulations. We provide a validation with experimental data, discuss methodological and theoretical implications, and make recommendations regarding the choice of analysis.},

For the Eurasian pole of inaccessibility (EPIA), the results reveal a misplacement in previous calculations ranging from 156 to 435 km. Although in general there is only one pole for a given coastline, the present calculations show that, within the error inherent to the definition of the coastline, two locations are candidates for EPIA, one equidistant from Gulf of Ob, Gulf of Bengal and Arabian Sea, and the other equidistant from Gulf of Ob, Gulf of Bengal and Gulf of Bohai, both poles being located in the north westernmost Chinese province of Xinjiang. The distance to the sea at these locations is 2510 and 2514 km respectively, about 120 km closer than generally thought.},

On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8\texttimes{} deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset.

Our approach is targeted at high-speed autonomous ground robot mobility, so real-time performance of the segmentation method plays a critical role. This is especially true as segmentation is considered only a necessary preliminary for the more important task of object classification that is itself computationally very demanding. Efficiency is achieved in our approach by splitting the segmentation problem into two simpler subproblems of lower complexity: local ground plane estimation followed by fast 2D connected components labeling. The method's performance is evaluated on real data acquired in different outdoor scenes, and the results are compared to those of existing methods. We show that our method requires less runtime while at the same time yielding segmentation results that are better suited for later classification of the identified objects.},

The normal vector of each laser point is an excellent feature to decompose the point cloud into segments describing planar patches. An objectbased error assessment is performed to determine the accuracy of the presented classification. It results in 94.4\% completeness and 88.4\% correctness. Once all roof planes are detected in the 3D point cloud, solar potential analysis is performed for each point. Shadowing effects of nearby objects are taken into account by calculating the horizon of each point within the point cloud. Effects of cloud cover are also considered by using data from a nearby meteorological station. As a result the annual sum of the direct and diffuse radiation for each roof plane is derived. The presented method uses the full 3D information for both feature extraction and solar potential analysis, which offers a number of new applications in fields where natural processes are influenced by the incoming solar radiation (e.g., evapotranspiration, distribution of permafrost). The presented method detected fully automatically a subset of 809 out of 1,071 roof planes where the arithmetic mean of the annual incoming solar radiation is more than 700 kWh/m2.},

To that end, segmentation and optimization are crucial analysis components of the shape abstraction process, which can themselves be greatly simplified when performed on lightened geometric formats. In this survey, we review the algorithms which extract simple geometric primitives from raw dense 3D data. After giving an introduction to these techniques, from the acquisition modality to the underlying theoretical concepts, we propose an application-oriented characterization, designed to help select an appropriate method based on one's application needs, and compare recent approaches. We conclude by giving hints for how to evaluate these methods and a set of research challenges to be explored.},

The extension can be interpreted as a generalization of the underlying mathematical framework to a screened Poisson equation. In contrast to other image and geometry processing techniques, the screening term is defined over a sparse set of points rather than over the full domain. We show that these sparse constraints can nonetheless be integrated efficiently. Because the modified linear system retains the same finite-element discretization, the sparsity structure is unchanged, and the system can still be solved using a multigrid approach. Moreover we present several algorithmic improvements that together reduce the time complexity of the solver to linear in the number of points, thereby enabling faster, higher-quality surface reconstructions.},

In particular, we consider the important case where there are many such queries to the same array, A, which resides entirely in RAM. In addition to the obvious sorted order/binary search combination we consider the Eytzinger breadth-first-search (BFS) layout normally used for heaps, an implicit B-tree layout that generalizes the Eytzinger layout, and the van Emde Boas layout commonly used in the cache-oblivious algorithms literature. After extensive testing and tuning on a wide variety of modern hardware, we arrive at the conclusion that, for small values of n, sorted order, combined with a good implementation of binary search, is best. For larger values of n, we arrive at the surprising conclusion that the Eytzinger layout is usually the fastest. The latter conclusion is unexpected and goes counter to earlier experimental work by Brodal, Fagerberg, and Jacob (SODA 2003), who concluded that both the B-tree and van Emde Boas layouts were faster than the Eytzinger layout for large values of n. Our fastest C++ implementations, when compiled, use conditional moves to avoid branch mispredictions and prefetching to reduce cache latency.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

In this paper, we present a fast approach to surface reconstruction in range images by means of approximate polygonal meshing. The obtained local surface information and neighborhoods are then used to 1) smooth the underlying measurements, and 2) segment the image into planar regions and other geometric primitives. An evaluation using publicly available data sets shows that our approach does not rank behind state-of-the-art algorithms while allowing to process range images at high frame rates.},

We propose three algorithm components required to utilize the plane features in an online Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem: fast plane extraction, frame-to-frame constraint estimation, and plane merging. For the fast plane extraction, we estimate local surface normals and curvatures by a simple spherical model and then segment points using a modified flood fill algorithm. In plane parameter estimation, we suggest a new uncertainty estimation method which is robust against the measurement bias, and also introduce a fast boundary modeling method. We associate the plane features based on both the parameters and the spatial coverage, and estimate the stable constraints by the cost function with a regulation term. Also, our plane merging technique provides a way of generating local maps that are useful for estimating loop closure constraints. We have performed real-world experiments at our lab environment. The results demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithm.},

The processing of the TLS data is discussed in detail in order to create digital surface models. The complexity of the cave required the integration of two techniques, TLS and close range photogrammetry to yield not only traditional drawings such as sections and elevations, but also photo-realistic perspective views and visual navigation worlds fully operational in 3D environments. This paper demonstrates the potential of integrating TLS and close range photogrammetry to provide both accurate digital surface models and photo-realistic outputs. This processed data can be used to systematically improve archaeological understanding of complex caves and relief panels of prehistoric art with tiny engravings.},

While laser scanners and digital photography have allowed us to capture increasingly larger datasets, previous techniques are computationally expensive, being unable to achieve real-time performance for datasets containing tens of thousands of points, even when detection is performed in a non-deterministic way. We present a deterministic technique for plane detection in unorganized point clouds whose cost is O(n log n) in the number of input samples. It is based on an efficient Hough-transform voting scheme and works by clustering approximately co-planar points and by casting votes for these clusters on a spherical accumulator using a trivariate Gaussian kernel. A comparison with competing techniques shows that our approach is considerably faster and scales significantly better than previous ones, being the first practical solution for deterministic plane detection in large unorganized point clouds.},

Whitebox GAT was designed to provide a platform for the rapid development and testing of experimental geospatial analysis methods, supported by its extensible design, integrated facilities for custom plug-in tool authoring, and its novel open-access design philosophy. One of the unique characteristics of Whitebox GAT is the ease with which users can inspect and modify the algorithms for individual geoprocessing tools. The open-access software model that Whitebox GAT adopts is designed to lessen the barriers that are often imposed on end-users when attempting to gain deeper understanding of how a specific function operates. While Whitebox GAT has an extensive range of GIS and remote sensing analytical capabilities, making it broadly suited for advanced scientific research applications in the Earth Sciences, this paper focusses on the software's application in the field of geomorphometry. An airborne LiDAR data set for a small headwater catchment of the Missisquoi River in northern Vermont, USA, was filtered to identify ground-points and then interpolated into a 2.0m resolution bare-Earth DEM. The DEM was processed to remove spurious off-ground objects (mainly buildings), to reduce surface roughness under heavy forest cover, and to hydrologically pre-condition the DEM. These data were then used to extract salient hydrological structures, i.e. the stream network and their associated sub-basins.},

Reconstruction of 3D building models is still a challenging issue in 3D city modelling. Point clouds generated from multi view images of UAV is a novel source of spatial data, which is used in this research for building reconstruction. The process starts with the segmentation of point clouds of roofs and walls into planar groups. By generating related surfaces and using geometrical constraints plus considering symmetry, a 3d model of building is reconstructed. In a refinement step, dormers are extracted, and their models are reconstructed. The details of the 3d reconstructed model are in LoD3 level, with respect to modelling eaves, fractions of roof and dormers.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The potential use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in civil and commercial applications is becoming a fact, and is receiving considerable attention by industry and the research community. The majority of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles performing civilian tasks are restricted to flying only in segregated space, and not within the National Airspace. The areas that UAVs are restricted to flying in are typically not above populated areas, which in turn are the areas most useful for civilian applications. The reasoning behind the current restrictions is mainly due to the fact that current UAV technologies are not able to demonstrate an Equivalent Level of Safety to manned aircraft, particularly in the case of an engine failure which would require an emergency or forced landing. This chapter will preset and guide the reader through a number of developments that would facilitate the integration of UAVs into the National Airspace. Algorithms for UAV Sense-and-Avoid and Force Landings are recognized as two major enabling technologies that will allow the integration of UAVs in the civilian airspace. The following sections will describe some of the techniques that are currently being tested at the Australian Research Centre for Aerospace Automation (ARCAA), which places emphasis on the detection of candidate landing sites using computer vision, the planning of the descent path trajectory for the UAV, and the decision making process behind the selection of the final landing site.},

Here we use a machine learning approach, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification, to classify 10,085 building roofs in relation to their received solar energy in the city of Geneva in Switzerland. The SVM correctly identifies six types of roof shapes in 66\% of cases, that is, flat \& shed, gable, hip, gambrel \& mansard, cross/corner gable \& hip, and complex roofs. We classify the roofs based on their useful area for PV installations and potential for receiving solar energy. For most roof shapes, the ratio between useful roof area and building footprint area is close to one, suggesting that footprint is a good measure of useful PV roof area. The main exception is the gable where this ratio is 1.18. The flat and shed roofs have the second highest useful roof area for PV (complex roof being the highest) and the highest PV potential (in GWh). By contrast, hip roof has the lowest PV potential. Solar roof-shape classification provides basic information for designing new buildings, retrofitting interventions on the building roofs, and efficient solar integration on the roofs of buildings.},

The role of uncertainty in dasymetric modeling has not been fully addressed as of yet. Uncertainty is usually present because most population data are themselves uncertain, or the geographic processes that connect population and the ancillary data layers are not precisely known. A new dasymetric methodology\textemdash the penalized maximum entropy dasymetric model (P\textendash MEDM)\textemdash is presented that enables these sources of uncertainty to be represented and modeled. The P\textendash MEDM propagates uncertainty through the model and yields fine-resolution population estimates with associated measures of uncertainty. This methodology contains a number of other benefits of theoretical and practical interest. In dasymetric modeling, researchers often struggle with identifying a relationship between population and ancillary data layers. The P\textendash MEDM model simplifies this step by unifying how ancillary data are included. The P\textendash MEDM also allows a rich array of data to be included, with disparate spatial resolutions, attribute resolutions, and uncertainties. Although the P\textendash MEDM does not necessarily produce more precise estimates than do existing approaches, it does help to unify how data enter the dasymetric model, it increases the types of data that can be used, and it allows geographers to characterize the quality of their dasymetric estimates. We present an application of the P\textendash MEDM that includes household-level survey data combined with higher spatial resolution data such as from census tracts, block groups, and land cover classifications.},

The shortest paths formed by the edges of 8-neighbor 2D grids can be up to {$\approx$} 8\% longer than the shortest paths in the continuous environment. Theta* typically finds much shorter paths than that by propagating information along graph edges (to achieve short runtimes) without constraining paths to be formed by graph edges (to find short "any-angle" paths). We show in this paper that the shortest paths formed by the edges of 26-neighbor 3D grids can be {$\approx$} 13\% longer than the shortest paths in the continuous environment, which highlights the need for smart path planning algorithms in 3D. Theta* can be applied to 3D grids in a straight-forward manner, but it performs a line-of-sight check for each unexpanded visible neighbor of each expanded vertex and thus it performs many more line-of-sight checks per expanded vertex on a 26-neighbor 3D grid than on an 8-neighbor 2D grid. We therefore introduce Lazy Theta*, a variant of Theta* which uses lazy evaluation to perform only one line-of-sight check per expanded vertex (but with slightly more expanded vertices). We show experimentally that Lazy Theta* finds paths faster than Theta* on 26-neighbor 3D grids, with one order of magnitude fewer line-of-sight checks and without an increase in path length.},

The geometric modeling and processing of man-made environments from measurement data often relies upon robust detection of planar primitive shapes. In addition, the detection and reinforcement of regularities between planar parts is a means to increase resilience to missing or defect-laden data as well as to reduce the complexity of models and algorithms down the modeling pipeline. The main novelty behind our method is to perform detection and regularization in tandem. We first sample a sparse set of seeds uniformly on the input point set, then perform in parallel shape detection through region growing, interleaved with regularization through detection and reinforcement of regular relationships (coplanar, parallel and orthogonal). In addition to addressing the end goal of regularization, such reinforcement also improves data fitting and provides guidance for clustering small parts into larger planar parts. We evaluate our approach against a wide range of inputs and under four criteria: geometric fidelity, coverage, regularity and running times. Our approach compares well with available implementations such as the efficient RANSAC-based approach proposed by Schnabel and co-authors in 2007.},

  abstract = {A fast pose-graph relaxation technique is presented for enhancing the consistency of three-dimensional (3D) maps created by registering large planar surface patches. The surface patches are extracted from point clouds sampled from a 3D range sensor. The plane-based registration method offers an alternative to the state-of-the-art algorithms and provides advantages in terms of robustness, speed, and storage. One of its features is that it results in an accurate determination of rotation, although a lack of predominant surfaces in certain directions may result in translational uncertainty in those directions. Hence, a loop-closing and relaxation problem is formulated that gains significant speed by relaxing only the translational errors and utilizes the full-translation covariance determined during pairwise registration. This leads to a fast 3D simultaneous localization and mapping suited for online operations. The approach is tested in two disaster scenarios that were mapped at the NIST 2008 Response Robot Evaluation Exercise in Disaster City, Texas. The two data sets from a collapsed car park and a flooding disaster consist of 26 and 70 3D scans, respectively. The results of these experiments show that our approach can generate 3D maps without motion estimates by odometry and that it outperforms iterative closest point\textendash based mapping with respect to speed and robustness. \textcopyright{} 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {For many applications such as environmental monitoring in the aftermath of a natural disaster and mountain search-and-rescue, swarms of autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have the potential to provide a highly versatile and often relatively inexpensive sensing platform. Their ability to operate as an `eye-in-the-sky', processing and relaying real-time colour imagery and other sensor readings facilitate the removal of humans from situations which may be considered dull, dangerous or dirty. However, as with manned aircraft they are likely to encounter errors, the most serious of which may require the UAV to land as quickly and safely as possible. Within this paper we therefore present novel work on autonomously identifying Safe Landing Zones (SLZs) which can be utilised upon occurrence of a safety critical event. Safe Landing Zones are detected and subsequently assigned a safety score either solely using multichannel aerial imagery or, whenever practicable by fusing knowledge in the form of Ordnance Survey (OS) map data with such imagery. Given the real-time nature of the problem we subsequently model two SLZ detection options one of which utilises knowledge enabling the UAV to choose an optimal, viable solution. Results are presented based on colour aerial imagery captured during manned flight demonstrating practical potential in the methods discussed.},

  abstract = {Loss of thrust emergencies-e.g., induced by bird/drone strikes or fuel exhaustion-create the need for dynamic data-driven flight trajectory planning to advise pilots or control UAVs. While total loss of thrust trajectories to nearby airports can be pre-computed for all initial points in a 3D flight plan, dynamic aspects such as partial power and airplane surface damage must be considered for accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new Dynamic Data-Driven Avionics Software (DDDAS) approach which during flight updates a damaged aircraft performance model, used in turn to generate plausible flight trajectories to a safe landing site. Our damaged aircraft model is parameterized on a baseline glide ratio for a clean aircraft configuration assuming best gliding airspeed on straight flight. The model predicts purely geometric criteria for flight trajectory generation, namely, glide ratio and turn radius for different bank angles and drag configurations. Given actual aircraft performance data, we dynamically infer the baseline glide ratio to update the damaged aircraft model. Our new flight trajectory generation algorithm thus can significantly improve upon prior Dubins based trajectory generation work by considering these data-driven geometric criteria. We further introduce a trajectory utility function to rank trajectories for safety. As a use case, we consider the Hudson River ditching of US Airways 1549 in January 2009 using a flight simulator to evaluate our trajectories and to get sensor data. In this case, a baseline glide ratio of 17.25:1 enabled us to generate trajectories up to 28 seconds after the birds strike, whereas, a 19:1 baseline glide ratio enabled us to generate trajectories up to 36 seconds after the birds strike. DDDAS can significantly improve the accuracy of generated flight trajectories thereby enabling better decision support systems for pilots in emergency conditions.},

  abstract = {Modern SLAM systems with a depth sensor are able to reliably reconstruct dense 3D geometric maps of indoor scenes. Representing these maps in terms of meaningful entities is a step towards building semantic maps for autonomous robots. One approach is to segment the 3D maps into semantic objects using Conditional Random Fields (CRF), which requires large 3D ground truth datasets to train the classification model. Additionally, the CRF inference is often computationally expensive. In this paper, we present an unsupervised geometric-based approach for the segmentation of 3D point clouds into objects and meaningful scene structures. We approximate an input point cloud by an adjacency graph over surface patches, whose edges are then classified as being either on or off. We devise an effective classifier which utilises both global planar surfaces and local surface convexities for edge classification. More importantly, we propose a novel global plane extraction algorithm for robustly discovering the underlying planes in the scene. Our algorithm is able to enforce the extracted planes to be mutually orthogonal or parallel which conforms usually with human-made indoor environments. We reconstruct 654 3D indoor scenes from NYUv2 sequences to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our segmentation method.},

SceneCut's joint reasoning over scene semantics and geometry allows a robot to detect and segment object instances in complex scenes where modern deep learning-based methods either fail to separate object instances, or fail to detect objects that were not seen during training. SceneCut automatically decomposes a scene into meaningful regions which either represent objects or scene surfaces. The decomposition is qualified by an unified energy function over objectness and geometric fitting. We show how this energy function can be optimized efficiently by utilizing hierarchical segmentation trees. Moreover, we leverage a pre-trained convolutional oriented boundary network to predict accurate boundaries from images, which are used to construct high-quality region hierarchies. We evaluate SceneCut on several different indoor environments, and the results show that SceneCut significantly outperforms all the existing methods.},

In this paper, we propose the use of risk maps to define the risk associated to accidents with unmanned aircraft. It is a two-dimensional location-based map that quantifies the risk to the population on ground of flight operations over a specified area. The risk map is generated through a probabilistic approach and combines several layers, including population density, sheltering factor, no-fly zones, and obstacles. Each element of the risk map has associated a risk value that quantifies the risk of flying over a specific location. Risk values are defined by a risk assessment process using different uncontrolled descent events, drone parameters, environmental characteristics, as well as uncertainties on parameters. The risk map is able to quantify the risk of large areas, such as urban environments, and allows for easy identification of high and low-risk locations. The map is a tool for informed decision making, and our results report some examples of risk map with different aircraft in a realistic urban environment.},

The first is to offer fast software-level algorithms for exact addition and multiplication of arbitrary precision floating-point values. The second is to propose a technique for adaptive precision arithmetic that can often speed these algorithms when they are used to perform multiprecision calculations that do not always require exact arithmetic, but must satisfy some error bound. The third is to use these techniques to develop implementations of several common geometric calculations whose required degree of accuracy depends on their inputs. These robust geometric predicates are adaptive; their running time depends on the degree of uncertainty of the result, and is usually small. These algorithms work on computers whose floating-point arithmetic uses radix two and exact rounding, including machines complying with the IEEE 754 standard. The inputs to the predicates may be arbitrary single or double precision floating-point numbers. C code is publicly available for the two-dimensional and three-dimensional orientation and incircle tests, and robust Delaunay triangulation using these tests. Timings of the implementations demonstrate their effectiveness.},

We enumerate and classify many of these variants, and evaluate their effect on the speed with which the correct alignment is reached. In order to improve convergence for nearly-flat meshes with small features, such as inscribed surfaces, we introduce a new variant based on uniform sampling of the space of normals. We conclude by proposing a combination of ICP variants optimized for high speed.

Instead, the robot's planner must compute an optimal or near-optimal path through the goals. This problem occurs, for instance, in spot-welding, inspection, and measurement tasks. It combines two computationally hard sub-problems: the shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems. This paper describes a greedy algorithm that operates under the assumption that the number of goals is relatively small (a few dozen at most) and the computational cost of finding a good path between two goals dominates that of finding a good tour in a graph with edges of given costs. Although the algorithm computes a quadratic number of goal-to-goal paths in the worst case, it is much faster in practice.},

Our method offers the every-pixel descriptive power of the latest dense SLAM approaches, but takes advantage directly of the planarity of many parts of real-world scenes via a data-driven process to directly regularize planar regions and represent their accurate extent efficiently using an occupancy approach with on-line compression. Large areas can be mapped efficiently and with useful semantic planar structure which enables intuitive and useful AR applications such as using any wall or other planar surface in a scene to display a user's content.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates cooperative search strategies for agents engaged in costly search in a complex environment. Searching cooperatively, several search goals can be satisfied within a single search effort. Given the searchers' preferences, the goal is to conduct a search in a way that the expected overall utility out of the set of opportunities found (e.g., products when operating in a market) minus the costs associated with finding that set is maximized. This search scheme, given in the context of a group search, applies also to scenarios where a single agent has to search for a set of items for satisfying several different goals. The uniqueness of the proposed mechanism is in the ability to partition the group of agents/goals into sub-groups where the search continues for each group autonomously. As we show throughout the paper, this strategy is favorable as it weakly dominates (i.e., can improve but never worsen) cooperative and autonomous search techniques. The paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the new search method and highlights the specific characteristics of the optimal search strategy. Furthermore, we introduce innovative algorithms for extracting the optimal search strategy in a range of common environments, that eliminates the computational overhead associated with the use of the partitioning technique.},

We evaluate our approach not only on the popular SegComp benchmark, but also provide a challenging synthetic dataset that overcomes SegComp's deficiencies.

The method consists of two stages. Firstly, noisy face normals are filtered iteratively by weighted averaging of neighboring face normals. Secondly, vertex positions are iteratively updated to agree with the denoised face normals. The weight function used during normal filtering is much simpler than that used in previous similar approaches, being simply a trimmed quadratic. This makes the algorithm both fast and simple to implement. Vertex position updating is based on the integration of surface normals using a least-squares error criterion. Like previous algorithms, we solve the least-squares problem by gradient descent, but whereas previous methods needed user input to determine the iteration step size, we determine it automatically. In addition, we prove the convergence of the vertex position updating approach. Analysis and experiments show the advantages of our proposed method over various earlier surface denoising methods.},

  abstract = {Very deep convolutional networks have been central to the largest advances in image recognition performance in recent years. One example is the Inception architecture that has been shown to achieve very good performance at relatively low computational cost. Recently, the introduction of residual connections in conjunction with a more traditional architecture has yielded state-of-the-art performance in the 2015 ILSVRC challenge; its performance was similar to the latest generation Inception-v3 network. This raises the question: Are there any benefits to combining Inception architectures with residual connections? Here we give clear empirical evidence that training with residual connections accelerates the training of Inception networks significantly. There is also some evidence of residual Inception networks outperforming similarly expensive Inception networks without residual connections by a thin margin. We also present several new streamlined architectures for both residual and non-residual Inception networks. These variations improve the single-frame recognition performance on the ILSVRC 2012 classification task significantly. We further demonstrate how proper activation scaling stabilizes the training of very wide residual Inception networks. With an ensemble of three residual and one Inception-v4 networks, we achieve 3.08\% top-5 error on the test set of the ImageNet classification (CLS) challenge.},

However, urban environments have a complex nature to model and they provide a challenge to investigate the current limits of automatic digital surface modeling from high resolution satellite imagery. An approach is introduced to improve a 3D surface model, extracted photogrammetrically from satellite imagery, based on the geometric building information embodied in existing 2D ground plans. First buildings are clipped from the extracted DSM based on the 2D polygonal building ground plans. To generate prismatic shaped structures with vertical walls and flat roofs, building shape is retrieved from the cadastre database while elevation information is extracted from the DSM. Within each 2D building boundary, a constant roof height is extracted based on statistical calculations of the height values. After buildings are extracted from the initial surface model, the remaining DSM is further processed to simplify to a smooth DTM that reflects bare ground, without artifacts, local relief, vegetation, cars and city furniture. In a next phase, both models are merged to yield an integrated city model or generalized DSM. The accuracy of the generalized surface model is assessed according to a quantitative-statistical analysis by comparison with two different types of reference data.},

To reduce the apparent faceting, smoothing methods are used. In this paper, we introduce a new method for smoothing piecewise linear shapes of arbitrary dimension and topology. This new method is in fact a linear low-pass filter that removes high-curvature variations, and does not produce shrinkage. Its computational complexity is linear in the number of edges or faces of the shape, and the required storage is linear in the number of vertices.{$<>$}},

Even when an algorithm can segment a complex model into its primitives, a description technique is still needed in order to identify the type of each primitive. Most feature extraction methods fail to describe these basic primitives or need a trained classifier on a database of prepared data to perform this identification. In this paper, we propose a method that can describe basic primitives such as planes, cones, cylinders, spheres, and tori as well as partial models of the latter four primitives. To achieve this task, we combine the concept of Gaussian sphere to a new concept introduced in this paper: the Gaussian accumulator. Comparison of the results of our method with other feature extractors reveals that our approach can distinguish all of these primitives from each other including partial models. Our method was also tested on real scanned data with noise and missing areas. The results show that our method is able to distinguish all of these models as well.},

We consider an alternative, namely Interpolation Search, which can take advantage of hardware trends by using complex calculations to save memory accesses. Historically, Interpolation Search was found to underperform compared to other search algorithms in this setting, despite its superior asymptotic complexity. Also, Interpolation Search is known to perform poorly on non-uniform data. To address these issues, we introduce SIP (Slope reuse Interpolation), an optimized implementation of Interpolation Search, and TIP (Three point Interpolation), a new search algorithm that uses linear fractions to interpolate on non-uniform distributions. We evaluate these two algorithms against a similarly optimized Binary Search method using a variety of real and synthetic datasets. We show that SIP is up to 4 times faster on uniformly distributed data and TIP is 2-3 times faster on non-uniformly distributed data in some cases. We also design a meta-algorithm to switch between these different methods to automate picking the higher performing search algorithm, which depends on factors like data distribution.},

By using active vision to detect safe landing zones below the aircraft, the reliability and safety of such systems is vastly improved by gathering up-to-the-minute information about the ground environment. This paper presents the Site Detection System, a methodology utilising a downward facing camera to analyse the ground environment in both 2D and 3D, detect safe landing sites and characterise them according to size, shape, slope and nearby obstacles. A methodology is presented showing the fusion of landing site detection from 2D imagery with a coarse Digital Elevation Map and dense 3D reconstructions using INS-aided Structure-from-Motion to improve accuracy. Results are presented from an experimental flight showing the precision/recall of landing sites in comparison to a hand-classified ground truth, and improved performance with the integration of 3D analysis from visual Structure-from-Motion.},

However, in some real-world machine learning scenarios, this assumption does not hold. There are cases where training data is expensive or difficult to collect. Therefore, there is a need to create high-performance learners trained with more easily obtained data from different domains. This methodology is referred to as transfer learning. This survey paper formally defines transfer learning, presents information on current solutions, and reviews applications applied to transfer learning. Lastly, there is information listed on software downloads for various transfer learning solutions and a discussion of possible future research work. The transfer learning solutions surveyed are independent of data size and can be applied to big data environments.},

Towards this we propose a novel convolutional architecture, termed SpiderCNN, to efficiently extract geometric features from point clouds. SpiderCNN is comprised of units called SpiderConv, which extend convolutional operations from regular grids to irregular point sets that can be embedded in RnRn\textbackslash mathbb \{R\}\^n, by parametrizing a family of convolutional filters. We design the filter as a product of a simple step function that captures local geodesic information and a Taylor polynomial that ensures the expressiveness. SpiderCNN inherits the multi-scale hierarchical architecture from classical CNNs, which allows it to extract semantic deep features. Experiments on ModelNet40 demonstrate that SpiderCNN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy 92.4\%92.4\%92.4 \textbackslash\% on standard benchmarks, and shows competitive performance on segmentation task.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a novel framework of the 3D reconstruction of buildings is proposed, focusing on remote sensing super-generalized stereo-pairs (SGSPs). As we all know, 3D reconstruction cannot be well performed using nonstandard stereo pairs, since reliable stereo matching could not be achieved when the image-pairs are collected at a great difference of views, and we always failed to obtain dense 3D points for regions of buildings, and cannot do further 3D shape reconstruction. We defined SGSPs as two or more optical images collected in less constrained views but covering the same buildings. It is even more difficult to reconstruct the 3D shape of a building by SGSPs using traditional frameworks. As a result, a dynamic multi-projection-contour approximating (DMPCA) framework was introduced for SGSP-based 3D reconstruction. The key idea is that we do an optimization to find a group of parameters of a simulated 3D model and use a binary feature-image that minimizes the total differences between projection-contours of the building in the SGSPs and that in the simulated 3D model. Then, the simulated 3D model, defined by the group of parameters, could approximate the actual 3D shape of the building. Certain parameterized 3D basic-unit-models of typical buildings were designed, and a simulated projection system was established to obtain a simulated projection-contour in different views. Moreover, the artificial bee colony algorithm was employed to solve the optimization. With SGSPs collected by the satellite and our unmanned aerial vehicle, the DMPCA framework was verified by a group of experiments, which demonstrated the reliability and advantages of this work.},

  abstract = {In this study, a hierarchical method for segmenting buildings in a digital surface model (DSM), which is used in a novel framework for 3D reconstruction, is proposed. Most 3D reconstructions of buildings are model-based. However, the limitations of these methods are overreliance on completeness of the offline-constructed models of buildings, and the completeness is not easily guaranteed since in modern cities buildings can be of a variety of types. Therefore, a model-free framework using high precision DSM and texture-images buildings was introduced. There are two key problems with this framework. The first one is how to accurately extract the buildings from the DSM. Most segmentation methods are limited by either the terrain factors or the difficult choice of parameter-settings. A level-set method are employed to roughly find the building regions in the DSM, and then a recently proposed `occlusions of random textures model' are used to enhance the local segmentation of the buildings. The second problem is how to generate the facades of buildings. Synergizing with the corresponding texture-images, we propose a roof-contour guided interpolation of building facades. The 3D reconstruction results achieved by airborne-like images and satellites are compared. Experiments show that the segmentation method has good performance, and 3D reconstruction is easily performed by our framework, and better visualization results can be obtained by airborne-like images, which can be further replaced by UAV images.},

This paper focuses on first order features, i.e., facet normals, and presents a simple yet effective anisotropic mesh denoising framework via normal field denoising. Unlike previous denoising methods based on normal filtering, which process normals defined on the Gauss sphere, our method considers normals as a surface signal defined over the original mesh. This allows the design of a novel bilateral normal filter that depends on both spatial distance and signal distance. Our bilateral filter is a more natural extension of the elegant bilateral filter for image denoising than those used in previous bilateral mesh denoising methods. Besides applying this bilateral normal filter in a local, iterative scheme, as common in most of previous works, we present for the first time a global, noniterative scheme for an isotropic denoising. We show that the former scheme is faster and more effective for denoising extremely noisy meshes while the latter scheme is more robust to irregular surface sampling. We demonstrate that both our feature-preserving schemes generally produce visually and numerically better denoising results than previous methods, especially at challenging regions with sharp features or irregular sampling.},

  abstract = {Although many efforts have been made on the fusion of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and aerial imagery for the extraction of houses, little research on taking advantage of a building's geometric features, properties, and structures for assisting the further fusion of the two types of data has been made. For this reason, this paper develops a seamless fusion between LiDAR and aerial imagery on the basis of aspect graphs, which utilize the features of houses, such as geometry, structures, and shapes. First, 3-D primitives, standing for houses, are chosen, and their projections are represented by the aspects. A hierarchical aspect graph is then constructed using aerial image processing in combination with the results of LiDAR data processing. In the aspect graph, the note represents the face aspect and the arc is described by attributes obtained by the formulated coding regulations, and the coregistration between the aspect and LiDAR data is implemented. As a consequence, the aspects and/or the aspect graph are interpreted for the extraction of houses, and then the houses are fitted using a planar equation for creating a digital building model (DBM). The experimental field, which is located in Wytheville, VA, is used to evaluate the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method is capable of effectively extracting houses at a successful rate of 93\%, as compared with another method, which is 82\% effective when LiDAR spacing is approximately 7.3 by 7.3 ft2. The accuracy of 3-D DBM is higher than the method using only single LiDAR data.},

Our approach has extended the state of the art in terrain assessment by incorporating not only plane fitting, but by also considering factors such as terrain/skid interaction, rotor and tail clearance, wind direction, clear approach/abort paths, and ground paths. In results from urban and natural environments we were able to successfully classify LZs from point cloud maps. We also present results from 8 successful landing experiments with varying ground clutter and approach directions. The helicopter selected its own landing site, approaches, and then proceeds to land.

	abstract = {This chapter reviews a representative research generated by the information processing approach to human cognition and presents some implications of this research for the design of safe, comfortable, and efficient aviation systems. The information processing approach has not been without its critics. It has been accused of playing 20 questions with nature and losing. The essence of this criticism is that the science has become too segmented along the line of specific experimental tasks, that is, one group studies the infinite permutations on choice reaction time tasks, another group studies memory search tasks, and another focuses only on tracking tasks. Thus, the science has produced an enormous catalog of information about a few rather esoteric laboratory tasks; yet it has contributed very little to the understanding of how humans function outside the laboratory in real-world settings. It is likely that the future success of the information processing approach will rest on its ability to deal with this criticism. There is a need for human factors specialists to widen their perspective beyond the relatively simple tasks that currently dominate research to increase the complexity of experimental tasks and to incorporate more ecologically valid sources of information. The information processing paradigm has contributed both knowledge and tools relevant for understanding human performance in aviation systems. The study of human performance in aviation systems provides an excellent opportunity to better understand general issues related to human cognition in complex environments.},

	abstract = {Many previous works on point sets learning achieve excellent performance with hierarchical architecture. Their strategies towards points agglomeration, however, only perform points sampling and grouping in original Euclidean space in a fixed way. These heuristic and task-irrelevant strategies severely limit their ability to adapt to more varied scenarios. To this end, we develop a novel hierarchical point sets learning architecture, with dynamic points agglomeration. By exploiting the relation of points in semantic space, a module based on graph convolution network is designed to learn a soft points cluster agglomeration. We construct a hierarchical architecture that gradually agglomerates points by stacking this learnable and lightweight module. In contrast to fixed points agglomeration strategy, our method can handle more diverse situations robustly and efficiently. Moreover, we propose a parameter sharing scheme for reducing memory usage and computational burden induced by the agglomeration module. Extensive experimental results on several point cloud analytic tasks, including classification and segmentation, well demonstrate the superior performance of our dynamic hierarchical learning framework over current state-of-the-art methods.},

Recently, deep learning on point clouds has become even thriving, with numerous methods being proposed to address different problems in this area. To stimulate future research, this paper presents a comprehensive review of recent progress in deep learning methods for point clouds.

However, there are many elements in the city that disturb the flight of the UAVs, such as various obstacles and urban canyons which can cause a multi-path effect of GPS signals, which degrades the accuracy of GPS-based localization. In order to empower the safety of the UAVs flying in urban areas, UAVs should be guided to a safe area even in a GPS-denied or network-disconnected environment. Also, UAVs must be able to avoid obstacles while landing in an urban area. For this purpose, we present the UAV detour system for operating UAV in an urban area. The UAV detour system includes a highly reliable laser guidance system to guide the UAVs to a point where they can land, and optical flow magnitude map to avoid obstacles for a safe landing.},

	abstract = {Solid-State LiDAR (SSL) takes an increasing share of the LiDAR market. Compared with traditional spinning LiDAR, SSLs are more compact, energy-efficient and cost-effective. Generally, the current study of SSL mapping is limited to adapting existing SLAM algorithms to an SSL sensor. However, compared with spinning LiDARs, SSLs are different in terms of their irregular scan patterns and limited FOV. Directly applying existing SLAM approaches on them often increase the instability of a mapping process. This study proposes a systematic design, which consists of a dual-LiDAR mapping system and a three DOF interpolated six DOF odometry. For dual-LiDAR mapping, this work uses a 2D LiDAR to enhance a 3D SSL performance on a ground vehicle platform. The proposed system takes a 2D LiDAR to preprocess the scanning field into a number of feature sections according to the curvatures on the 2D fraction. Subsequently, this section information is passed to 3D SSL for direction feature selection. Additionally, this work proposes an odometry interpolation method which uses both LiDARs to generate two separated odometries. The proposed odometry interpolation method selectively determines the appropriate odometry information to update the system state under challenging conditions. Experiments are conducted in different scenarios. The results proves that the proposed approach is able to utilise 12 times more corner features from the environment than the comparied method, thus results in a demonstrable improvement in its absolute position error.},

In general, the SLAM framework employs the camera, IMU, wheel encoder and can not lack the combination of the Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors for superior accuracy for the navigation system. Nevertheless, the price of mechanical LiDAR is exceptionally high compared with other sensors, which is the primary reason to introduce a new generation of laser called Solid-State LiDAR (SSL). In this paper, we introduce a back-ground of SSL and several types of commercial SSL and also their characteristic. For developing SLAM framework, we discuss several successful SLAM architectures, which can be capable of integrating into a navigation system for the mobile robot. Last, we propose a low-cost SLAM framework using the visual-inertial-SSL, that can not only reduce the price of a mobile industrial robot but also provide excellent performance.},

	url = {https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA239610},
	abstract = {A combined analysis and flight test program was conducted to investigate the characteristics of the decision-height DH window for helicopter decelerating instrument approaches. The concept of an effective flight path angle has been employed to define the DH window in terms of basic rotorcraft performance data. Exploratory flight tests were conducted to validate this approach and to define the approximate dimensions of the DH window 50 feet above ground level. The flight test experiment included an instrument meteorological conditions IMC decelerating instrument approach with errors built into the flight director to cause the helicopter to arrive at the decision-height with some glideslope and groundspeed errors. The pilots were required to visually maneuver the rotorcraft from decision-height to a steady hover over the helipad. The decision-height window was formulated on a grid of glideslope error versus the groundspeed at decision-height. The results indicate that the high speed boundary of the DH window is a function of the minimum usable torque, and related to maximum acceptable pitch attitude during deceleration. Some margin is required to account for pilot delay or control misapplication after breakout. The upper glideslope error boundary is based on the maximum negative aerodynamic flight path angle that can be flown at low airspeeds. Poor visual cuing after breakout tends to emphasize the need for margins from the helicopter performance. The low speed boundary of the DH window is based on rotorcraft handling qualities at very low airspeeds. The low glideslope boundary is dependent on obstruction avoidance and ability to see the heliport environment upon breakout at decision-height.},

Human judgment and decision making for this application is not well-characterized. To address this knowledge deficiency, an experiment was designed to replicate the landing point designation task in both ideal and poor landing conditions. Fifteen helicopter pilots were observed to use one of two strategy types, with both strategies resulting in equatable performance. Regardless of strategy use, terrain contrast conditions were observed to have a significant impact on the selection of safe landing sites. Other aspects of performance, such as task completion time, were unaffected by terrain contrast. Pilots were also observed to be influenced by multiple terrain factors. Researchers noted twenty different types of actions stemming from nine categories of scenario cues. When these cue–action relationships are used in conjunction with pilots’ evaluation criteria and a known strategy, models can be developed to predict decision making.},

	abstract = {Autonomous landing of a drone is a necessary part of autonomous flight. One way to have high certainty of safety in landing is to return to the same location the drone took-off from. Implementations of return-to-home functionality fall short when relying solely on GPS or odometry as inaccuracies in the measurements and drift in the state estimate guides the drone to a position with a large offset from the initial position. This can be particularly dangerous if the drone took-off next to something like a body of water. Current work on precision landing relies on localizing to a known landing pattern, which requires the pilot to carry a landing pattern with them. We propose a method using a downward facing fisheye lens camera to accurately land a UAV from where it took off on an unstructured surface, without a landing pattern. Specifically, this approach uses a position estimate relative to the take-off path of the drone to guide the drone back. With the large Field-of-View provided by the fisheye lens, our algorithm can provide visual feedback starting with a large position error at the beginning of the landing, until 25 cm above the ground at the end of the landing. This algorithm empirically shows it can correct the drift error in the state estimation and land with an accuracy of 40 cm.},

	abstract = {Simulators have played a critical role in robotics research as tools for quick and efficient testing of new concepts, strategies, and algorithms. To date, most simulators have been restricted to 2D worlds, and few have matured to the point where they are both highly capable and easily adaptable. Gazebo is designed to fill this niche by creating a 3D dynamic multi-robot environment capable of recreating the complex worlds that would be encountered by the next generation of mobile robots. Its open source status, fine grained control, and high fidelity place Gazebo in a unique position to become more than just a stepping stone between the drawing board and real hardware: data visualization, simulation of remote environments, and even reverse engineering of blackbox systems are all possible applications. Gazebo is developed in cooperation with the Player and Stage projects (Gerkey, B. P., et al., July 2003), (Gerkey, B. P., et al., May 2001), (Vaughan, R. T., et al., Oct. 2003), and is available from http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/gazebo/ gazebo.html.},

	abstract = {The development of a navigation system is one of the major challenges in building a fully autonomous platform. Full autonomy requires a dependable navigation capability not only in a perfect situation with clear GPS signals but also in situations, where the GPS is unreliable. Therefore, self-contained odometry systems have attracted much attention recently. This paper provides a general and comprehensive overview of the state of the art in the field of self-contained, i.e., GPS denied odometry systems, and identifies the out-coming challenges that demand further research in future. Self-contained odometry methods are categorized into five main types, i.e., wheel, inertial, laser, radar, and visual, where such categorization is based on the type of the sensor data being used for the odometry. Most of the research in the field is focused on analyzing the sensor data exhaustively or partially to extract the vehicle pose. Different combinations and fusions of sensor data in a tightly/loosely coupled manner and with filtering or optimizing fusion method have been investigated. We analyze the advantages and weaknesses of each approach in terms of different evaluation metrics, such as performance, response time, energy efficiency, and accuracy, which can be a useful guideline for researchers and engineers in the field. In the end, some future research challenges in the field are discussed.},

	abstract = {Here we propose a real-time method for low-drift odometry and mapping using range measurements from a 3D laser scanner moving in 6-DOF. The problem is hard because the range measurements are received at different times, and errors in motion estimation (especially without an external reference such as GPS) cause mis-registration of the resulting point cloud. To date, coherent 3D maps have been built by off-line batch methods, often using loop closure to correct for drift over time. Our method achieves both low-drift in motion estimation and low-computational complexity. The key idea that makes this level of performance possible is the division of the complex problem of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping, which seeks to optimize a large number of variables simultaneously, into two algorithms. One algorithm performs odometry at a high-frequency but at low fidelity to estimate velocity of the laser scanner. Although not necessary, if an IMU is available, it can provide a motion prior and mitigate for gross, high-frequency motion. A second algorithm runs at an order of magnitude lower frequency for fine matching and registration of the point cloud. Combination of the two algorithms allows map creation in real-time. Our method has been evaluated by indoor and outdoor experiments as well as the KITTI odometry benchmark. The results indicate that the proposed method can achieve accuracy comparable to the state of the art offline, batch methods.},

	doi = {10.23919/ChiCC.2017.8028435},
	abstract = {Odometry is a very popular research direction in recent decades and plays a very critical role in the autonomous navigation system. VISO2, as a relatively robust and mature visual odometry algorithm, becomes unreliable when distinct visual features are insufficiently or when the texture of the environment is repetitive. Even if not in such a challenging environment, the drift is still a big problem for the practical application. LOAM, a lidar odometry algorithm, has been leading the way for the performance on KITTI data set. In fact, it also has limitations in shape features not prominent environment, like a highway with few buildings around. Considering that the current mobile unmanned platforms (e.g., unmanned vehicles) are almost equipped with both lidar and cameras, this paper proposes a loose coupling visual-lidar odometry by combining VISO2 and LOAM to achieve the advantages of both camera and lidar and reduce the number of restricted scenarios. The algorithm proposed in this paper is tested on the raw data set of KITTI. The average translation error is about 1.37\% on 10 sequences, and the accuracy is improved with respect to LOAM with the same parameters. With the help of VISO2, the algorithm also performs well in shape features not prominent environment (e.g., highway), and from the experiment results, we confirmed the efficient strategy to combine VISO2 and LOAM to adapt to challenging environment and to keep the accuracy of the algorithm.},

In this paper, an effective lidar and IMU fusion based point cloud distortion removing and mapping algorithm is proposed. UKF is used to fuse the angular velocity, linear acceleration of the IMU and the pose of the lidar. It can get the angular velocity bias, linear acceleration bias of the IMU and the linear velocity of the lidar. Then the pose of the lidar at each time in a scanning period is obtained, therefore the distortion of the point cloud can be removed. UKF can also estimate the pose of the lidar, which can be used as the initial value of the point cloud registration algorithm in lidar odometry, therefore the computation time can be reduced. The rapid rotation and rapid translation motion experiments show that the proposed method can deal with the rapid motion of lidar, and achieve high efficiency and precision mapping.},

We implemented a generic meta-architecture via a decoupled design where different types of encoders and decoders can be plugged in independently. We provide several example encoders including VGG16, Resnet18, MobileNet, and ShuffleNet and decoders including SkipNet, UNet and Dilation Frontend. The framework is scalable for addition of new encoders and decoders developed in the community for other vision tasks. We performed detailed experimental analysis on cityscapes dataset for various combinations of encoder and decoder. The modular framework enabled rapid prototyping of a custom efficient architecture which provides x143 GFLOPs reduction compared to SegNet and runs real-time at 15 fps on NVIDIA Jetson TX2.

	abstract = {In this work we address the task of semantic image segmentation with Deep Learning and make three main contributions that are experimentally shown to have substantial practical merit. First, we highlight convolution with upsampled filters, or `atrous convolution', as a powerful tool in dense prediction tasks. Atrous convolution allows us to explicitly control the resolution at which feature responses are computed within Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. It also allows us to effectively enlarge the field of view of filters to incorporate larger context without increasing the number of parameters or the amount of computation. Second, we propose atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) to robustly segment objects at multiple scales. ASPP probes an incoming convolutional feature layer with filters at multiple sampling rates and effective fields-of-views, thus capturing objects as well as image context at multiple scales. Third, we improve the localization of object boundaries by combining methods from DCNNs and probabilistic graphical models. The commonly deployed combination of max-pooling and downsampling in DCNNs achieves invariance but has a toll on localization accuracy. We overcome this by combining the responses at the final DCNN layer with a fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF), which is shown both qualitatively and quantitatively to improve localization performance. Our proposed “DeepLab” system sets the new state-of-art at the PASCAL VOC-2012 semantic image segmentation task, reaching 79.7 percent mIOU in the test set, and advances the results on three other datasets: PASCAL-Context, PASCAL-Person-Part, and Cityscapes.

	abstract = {We present a novel and practical deep fully convolutional neural network architecture for semantic pixel-wise segmentation termed SegNet. This core trainable segmentation engine consists of an encoder network, a corresponding decoder network followed by a pixel-wise classification layer. The architecture of the encoder network is topologically identical to the 13 convolutional layers in the VGG16 network [1] . The role of the decoder network is to map the low resolution encoder feature maps to full input resolution feature maps for pixel-wise classification. The novelty of SegNet lies is in the manner in which the decoder upsamples its lower resolution input feature map(s). Specifically, the decoder uses pooling indices computed in the max-pooling step of the corresponding encoder to perform non-linear upsampling. This eliminates the need for learning to upsample. The upsampled maps are sparse and are then convolved with trainable filters to produce dense feature maps. We compare our proposed architecture with the widely adopted FCN [2] and also with the well known DeepLab-LargeFOV [3] , DeconvNet [4] architectures. This comparison reveals the memory versus accuracy trade-off involved in achieving good segmentation performance. SegNet was primarily motivated by scene understanding applications. Hence, it is designed to be efficient both in terms of memory and computational time during inference. It is also significantly smaller in the number of trainable parameters than other competing architectures and can be trained end-to-end using stochastic gradient descent. We also performed a controlled benchmark of SegNet and other architectures on both road scenes and SUN RGB-D indoor scene segmentation tasks. These quantitative assessments show that SegNet provides good performance with competitive inference time and most efficient inference memory-wise as compared to other architectures. We also provide a Caffe implementation of SegNet and a web demo at http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/projects/segnet/.},

In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, improve on the previous best result in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build “fully convolutional” networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet, the VGG net, and GoogLeNet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task. We then define a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional networks achieve improved segmentation of PASCAL VOC (30\% relative improvement to 67.2\% mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, SIFT Flow, and PASCAL-Context, while inference takes one tenth of a second for a typical image.},

We extend a well-known monocular visual SLAM algorithm that enables autonomous navigation of the MAV in unknown environments, in order to search for such landing sites. Furthermore, a multi-scale ORB feature based method is implemented and integrated into the SLAM framework for landing site detection. We use a RANSAC-based method to locate the landing site within the map of the SLAM system, taking advantage of those map points associated with the detected landing site.

Our simulator includes a physics engine that can operate at a high frequency for real-time hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) simulations with support for popular protocols (e.g. MavLink). The simulator is designed from the ground up to be extensible to accommodate new types of vehicles, hardware platforms and software protocols. In addition, the modular design enables various components to be easily usable independently in other projects.

This has led to a rapid growth in the LiDAR manufacturing industry with several competing makers releasing new sensors regularly. With this increased variety of LiDARs, each with different properties such as number of laser emitters, resolution, field-of-view, and price tags, a more in-depth comparison of their characteristics and performance is required. This work compares 10 commonly used 3D LiDARs, establishing several metrics to assess their performance. Various outstanding issues with specific LiDARs were qualitatively identified. The accuracy and precision of individual LiDAR beams and accumulated point clouds are evaluated in a controlled environment at distances from 5 to 180 meters. Reflective targets were used to characterize intensity patterns and quantify the impact of surface reflectivity on accuracy and precision. A vehicle and pedestrian mannequin were also used as additional targets of interest. A thorough assessment of these LiDARs is given with their potential applicability for automated driving tasks. The data collected in these experiments and analysis tools are all shared openly.},

Finally, the results of the adjustment along with a detailed examination of the adjustment residuals are given. A three-fold improvement in the planar misclosure residual RMSE over the standard factory calibration model was achieved by the proposed calibration. Results also suggest that there may still be some unmodelled distortions in the range measurements from the scanner.

	abstract = {The use and research of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) have been increasing over the years due to the applicability in several operations such as search and rescue, delivery, surveillance, and others. Considering the increased presence of these vehicles in the airspace, it becomes necessary to reflect on the safety issues or failures that the UAVs may have and the appropriate action. Moreover, in many missions, the vehicle will not return to its original location. If it fails to arrive at the landing spot, it needs to have the onboard capability to estimate the best area to safely land. This paper addresses the scenario of detecting a safe landing spot during operation. The algorithm classifies the incoming Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data and store the location of suitable areas. The developed method analyses geometric features on point cloud data and detects potential right spots. The algorithm uses the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to find planes in point cloud clusters. The areas that have a slope less than a threshold are considered potential landing spots. These spots are evaluated regarding ground and vehicle conditions such as the distance to the UAV, the presence of obstacles, the area’s roughness, and the spot’s slope. Finally, the output of the algorithm is the optimum spot to land and can vary during operation. The proposed approach evaluates the algorithm in simulated scenarios and an experimental dataset presenting suitability to be applied in real-time operations.},

In this paper, a new method to autonomously select safe landing sites from LiDAR point clouds is proposed. Principal component analysis CPCA) and an improved region growing algorithm are utilized to detect flat regions, where plane fitting is executed afterwards for terrain complexity assessment using an improved progressive sample consensus (PROSAC) algorithm. The most suitable landing site of a landing zone is selected according to the terrain complexity. Terrain point clouds of urban and natural scenes are used for simulation experiments. Experimental results show that the landing zones can be classified successfully and the selected landing sitescan meet the safety requirements, which demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of our proposed method.},

The key novelty of this system is the coupling of a volumetric occupancy map with a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which to the best of our knowledge has not been previously done. This architecture allows us to train an extremely efficient and highly accurate system for detection tasks from raw occupancy data. We apply this method to the problem of detecting safe landing zones for autonomous helicopters from LiDAR point clouds. Current methods for this problem rely on heuristic rules and use simple geometric features. These heuristics break down in the presence of low vegetation, as they do not distinguish between vegetation that may be landed on and solid objects that should be avoided. We evaluate the system with a combination of real and synthetic range data. We show our system outperforms various benchmarks, including a system integrating various hand-crafted point cloud features from the literature.},

This paper develops a ground impact and hazard mitigation (GIHM) module that integrates the following: 1) consideration of engine and control surface failure flight modes, 2) generation of feasible ground impact footprints based on glide equations, 3) selection of safest response ground impact sites based on a high-resolution LandScan USA population dataset, and 4) controlled descent to a selected site. For a sample population distribution, integration of GIHM with standard UAV flight software shows a maximum casualty expectation reduction of 97\% compared to the flight software without GIHM near highly populated areas. Incorporation of this hazard mitigation module is successful in reducing fatalities per flight hour, bringing UAVs closer to being safe enough for integration into the National Airspace System.},

In this paper, we use terrain information from digital elevation maps to find a list of potential landing sites, selecting a site from the list and determine a path to the selected site in a given time.

Recent improvements in the resolution of remotely sensed imagery, and image-processing tools and software have facilitated improvement of methods for the detection of individual, generally large-bodied animals. The potential to monitor and survey populations from remotely sensed imagery is an exciting new development in animal ecology. We review the methods used to analyse remotely sensed imagery for their potential to estimate the abundance of wild and domestic animal populations by directly detecting, identifying and counting individuals. Despite many illustrative studies using a variety of methods for detecting animals from remotely sensed imagery, it remains problematic in many situations. Studies that demonstrated reasonably high accuracy using automated and semi-automated techniques have been undertaken on small spatial scales relative to the geographical range of the species of interest and/or in homogenous environments such as sea ice. The major limitations are the relatively low accuracy of automated detection techniques across large spatial extents, false detections and the cost of high-resolution data. Future developments in the analysis of remotely sensed data for population surveys will improve detection capabilities, including the advancement of algorithms, the crossover of software and technology from other disciplines, and improved availability, accessibility, cost and resolution of data.},

This study developed a new, cost-effective approach to assessing green roof development potential by using ultra-high-resolution (UHR) (0.09 m) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imagery in a case study site (Central Luohe with an area of 158 km2) in China. Specifically, the data was processed, interpreted, and classified to create highly accurate land-use and building roof spatial resources databases. A decision-making flowchart was developed for preliminary determination of a building stock's suitability for green roof implementation and the preferred type based on the five influencing factors and building roof classification. Subsequently, a two-stage strategy for large-scale green roof development was proposed. The approach demonstrated in this research greatly improves the accuracy of city-scale studies on roof spatial resources and enables better planning and development of urban green spaces at the local level.},

However, those applications do not widely spread as the safety consideration hinders the UAV from integrating into civilian environment. This work focuses on investigating the UAV emergency landing problem which is a critical safety functionality of UAV. This work proposed a Graph Convolution Networkbased decision network to learn by imitating the human pilots' landing strategy. To alleviate the needs of a large amount of real-world data for model training, the proposed model allows to be trained in a simulated environment and then transferred to the real-world scenario due to the separation of domain-specific terrain classes and domain-independent topological structures among down-looking camera images. The Graph Convolution Network-based decision network can be coupled with a topological heuristic to improve the performance of action prediction in emergency situation. To evaluate the proposed method, this work implemented a simulation environment for collecting data and testing the UAV emergency landing. The empirical results in both simulated and real-world scenario show that the proposed methods can outperform the state-of-the-art counterparts in terms of predictive accuracy and success landing rate.},

This creates a need for Advanced Driver Assist Systems (ADAS) which can ensure safe travel. To tackle the above challenge in existing the ADAS, Intra-vehicular communications (V2V) and vehicle to infrastructure communications (V2I) has been one of the predominant research topics nowadays due to the rapid growth of automobile industries and ideology of producing autonomous cars in the near future. The key feature of V2V communication is vehicle to vehicle collision detection by transmitting information like vehicle speed and position of a vehicle to other vehicles in the same location using wireless sensor networks (WSN). On the other hand, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems are growing at a rapid rate in various aspects of life including dispatch of medicines and undergo video surveillance during an emergency due to less air traffic. This paper demonstrates the practice of integrating V2V communication with Thread, one of the low power WSN for data transmission, to initiate adaptive cruise control in a vehicle during a crisis. Also, UAV systems are employed as a part of V2I system to provide aerial view video surveillance if any accident occurs.},

	abstract = {For many software applications, it is sometimes necessary to find the rectangle of largest area inscribed in a polygon, in any possible direction. Thus, given a closed contour C, we consider approximation algorithms for the problem of finding the largest area rectangle of arbitrary orientation that is fully contained in C. Furthermore, we compute the largest area rectangle of arbitrary orientation in a quasi-lattice polygon, which models the C contour. In this paper, we propose an approximation algorithm that solves this problem with an O(n3) computational cost, where n is the number of vertices of the polygon. There is no other algorithm having lower computational complexity regardless of any constraints. In addition, we have developed a web application that uses the proposed algorithm.},

	abstract = {The foundation for a collaborative, man-machine system for adaptive performance of tasks in a multiple, heterogeneous unmanned system teaming environment is discussed. An autonomics system is proposed to monitor missions and overall system attributes, including those of the operator, autonomy, states of the world, and the mission. These variables are compared within a model of the global system, and strategies that re-allocate tasks can be executed based on a mission-health perspective (such as relieving an overloaded user by taking over incoming tasks). Operators still have control over the allocation via a task manager, which also provides a function allocation interface, and accomplishes an initial attempt at transparency. We plan to learn about configurations of function allocation from human-in-the-loop experiments, using machine learning and operator feedback. Integrating autonomics, machine learning, and operator feedback is expected to improve collaboration, transparency, and human-machine performance.},
